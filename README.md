# DataStructures_Homework

Notes:

Sorry for putting the task in different folders, 
but already submitted the first part. Will refactor it
if needs to.


Homework Part 1(from Monday)

First 4 tasks are in the Homework folder, 
because I didn't find a template or a file where to write or complete them, 
so I created my own ones. The final task about summing two linked lists is
in 006_DataStructures/b004_singly_linked_list/linked_list.py


Homework Part 2(from Wednesday)

I suppose the solution for the intersection sorted arrays is just for example,
so I did it in a different way. The two files are in: Part_2\006_DataStructures\b007_arrays:
- Homework_intersection_sorted_arrays.py
- Homework_optimal_task_assignment.py
